<h1>Sketches</h1>
<p>Through sketching I am able to push myself to the least inhibited fringes of creative intuition, discovering expanded means for expressing thought in being forcefully liberated beyond my familiarities. Sketching is usually an effective catalyst in initiating the theme or tone of an artwork. Most of my work, sculpture, is conceived in the abstract. These sketches are developmental, not serving as literal blueprints for work, but allowing me to grasp some parts of the finished  idea of a desired concept before committing to the arduous physical (and further interpretative) process of bringing it to cohesive realization. </p>
