    <p>My work addresses structure and tensions in environment, form and identity. Drawn to mapping concepts of wholeness, I abstract, deconstruct and reinterpret elements, reconfiguring associations of character, utility and nature. This process projects me into perspectives of open examination, questioning, discovery and ordering that I hope are catalyzed through the resulting artwork. My aesthetics are largely directed by elements of line and form steered by intuition and inspired by sensibilities of constructivist and expressionist art movements. My production techniques are a loose and layered mixture of traditional and experimental processes including sculpting, metalworking, casting, assemblage, drawing, painting and patination.</p>
    <p>I often work in abstraction. As a style I believe it activates and enhances perception, prompting visual ordering that illuminates structure and creative potential in composition. The use of abstraction in African and American art interests me in connection to my cultural and native backgrounds. Both cultures and their histories hold varying priorities in considering the relevance of art to the workings of humanity and society. Between these I explore relationships in the use of abstraction articulate religious, emotional, observational and social meaning.</p>
