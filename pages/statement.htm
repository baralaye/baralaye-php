    <p>Art is the means through which I mediate my engagement of otherness. I use form, materials and marks in a vocabulary that addresses the poetics, philosophies and tensions of my cultural orientation across Eastern, Western, appropriated and alternative traditions. This includes structures of social and emotive communication and understandings of spiritual metaphysics. I am interested in the metaphorical utility and particularization of elements, how things become content within specific contexts. I use objects to highlight the spaces around and between defined meanings and realities, presenting a shifted awareness steeped in my own history and identity. My work is largely composed through intuition using a loose and layered mixture of traditional and experimental processes including sculpting, casting, assemblage and drawing.</p>
