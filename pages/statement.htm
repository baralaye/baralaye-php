  <p>My life and generation dwell in the engagement of fragmented and transitional presence. We have become increasingly used to holding or abandoning understandings of where we come from, where we are and the multiple realities we are intended for, all in the same moment. I use art as a way to deconstruct and expand that moment. In my work I compose objects that are markers of place, narrative and state and the dualities around them. I explore symbols and visual forms that deconstruct spirituality, emotion and culture relative to my experience. Sourcing my narrative of migration from Nigeria through the Caribbean and to the United States I use form as language to mediate engagement and displacement towards society, dwelling/home and faith.</p>
  <p>I am interested in the psychological agency of objects that project manifestations of identity and desire: shrines, statues, monuments, urns. I am also drawn to the poetics of domesticity and utility, positioning design and function as ways of feeling within ways of ordering. I at times work in multiples through the production processes of pattern-making and mold-making, shifting between conditions of collective and individual representation that I relate to negations of cultural and personal authorship. I use natural materials: clay, fiber and wood, as well as synthetic materials: metal, plaster and resins. My production processes rely on degrees of preliminary planning: sketches, blueprints and digital models. Along with those, development is intuitively driven and sensitive to further technical and conceptual discovery.</p>
