  <p>Art has the ability to change the way people see and experience the world. Specifically, it has the ability to both clarify and challenge the way we understand who and what we are in the world. I use art as a vehicle to navigate and articulate conditions of sociological, spiritual and philosophical displacement. Consequently, my work focuses on experiential observations and conditions of life. Key elements of interest are: iconography, the object as a symbol and capsule for the transmission and engagement of information and ideas; cultural and social identity - in particular my own as a Nigerian American of the millennial generation; and object ontology, the study of how objects operate independent of prescriptive meaning. What drives the dimensional nature of my work is the compulsion to investigate things through creation, making ideas and concerns tangible to the mind and the body. In my work I manipulate cultural, functional, and metaphysical themes to contextualize and interrogate the phenomenon of otherness around and within me.</p>
