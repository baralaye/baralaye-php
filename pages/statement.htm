  <p>My work is motivated by dynamics of desire and understandings of identity extending through personal experience. As a Nigerian American raised in the Caribbean I identify ethnically, culturally and nationally with three different countries. As a person of faith my values are shaped by organized truths existing in disparate spiritual and material expressions. As an individual in society I embrace the diverse poetics, peculiarities and variability of social communication. I create work to both reconcile and celebrate the tensions of otherness that I am drawn to and live through.</p>
